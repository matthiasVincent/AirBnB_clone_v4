# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

### About web_static
Web_static contains static files- html, css and images(Javascript will be added as we delve deeper into the ALX SE school `AirBnB_clone` project(s).
The project is just a whirlwind tour into html and css. It practically explore the html semantic tags with some dummy contents which will be fetched from database in a later project. These elements were styled using CSS styling techniques. I have turned this repository to a live static site. You can see how the different html files given below are rendered in a browser by clicking the link below (I will just pick a random file, you only have to change it by substituting each one you feel like viewing with the random one I have selected)
